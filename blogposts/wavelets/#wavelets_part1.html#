<p>Since my last post was on the <a href="http://michaeljflynn.net/2017/03/20/history-and-derivation-of-the-fast-fourier-transform/">fast fourier transform</a> I thought I would continue the theme of signal processing and write a post on wavelets. However after looking over the subject for a couple reasons I’ve decided to split this topic into several posts, since it is a much more general topic. Where the fourier transform was a single transform to frequency space, wavelet transforms are a family of transforms to “wavelet” space</p>
<p>Wavelets are a little more interesting to look at than fourier transforms, because every real signal comes in non-eternal packets of information. Think of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9. In theory, you <em>could</em> produce the symphony by assembling an infinite orchestra of trombones and having them each play a steady note. If you tuned them correctly and set the volumes right, you could produce the whole sympony, stringed instruments and all. That is how the Fourier Series works. However, that’s not how we usually think of music. Music is played with a finite number of instruments for non-constant intervals.</p>
<p>Note on the target audience of this article: I use the “talking to myself” format . I have an undergraduate degree in physics as well as computer science, and so those with similar backgrounds should be able to follow along. Some with less technical backgrounds might have a tough time following along, some with more experience in this area will find that I am not being accurate/thorough enough. I will do my best to reduce the collective pain points from both sides.</p>
