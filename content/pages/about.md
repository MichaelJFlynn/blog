title: About Me
slug: about-me


When I was in high school I checked out a copy of "Road to Reality" by
Roger Penrose. The book is notorious its steep ramp up from basic math
to feynman diagrams in about 900 pages, and I read up to the point
where Penrose introduced the upside-down triangle "nabla" symbol for
gradient. Since I was in no way precocious, I tapped out
there. Nevertheless I fell in love with physics and understanding
'ultimate' reality with math. This inspired me to devote myself to the
quantitative sciences, including computer science as well. 

In my undergraduate degree I pursued this goal.


I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in Applied Physics with a focus on
Synthetic Biology. I am currently tinkering on my next project.

I was co-first author on a [paper on a toolkit of miRNA regulatory
circuits](). I have written another [paper on applying miRNA regulatory
circuits to Rett Syndrome gene therapy]().

Recently, I've tried to return to the humanities as well, which I've
always felt was important, but sadly neglected for the pursuit of
divine knowledge from the sciences.

What do I do?



What do I like to do?
- obviously I enjoy writing and thinking about algorithms
- physics.
- 

I also like to program.

I really like reading books.
